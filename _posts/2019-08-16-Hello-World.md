**Success Notice:** HELLO WORLD!!
{: .notice--success}

So its been a long time since I have done this.. I wanted a site where I can keep records of all the random things I get up-to, and also provide me a how-to for future reference and reproduction. 

For reference, this site is hosted on [GitHub][Github-site], and uses [Jekyll][jekyll-docs]. I am also using [Minimal Mistakes][MinMist-site] for my theme.

One of the first guides ill publish is what I did here to make that happen. Some other things on the short list include:
* Programing MD-380 for HAM use
* Getting FCC frequencies in the IG Pool
* Plex... and Plex automation
* Tape backups
* USG VPN programing

And other things as I get to them... in the mean time:

**Warning Notice:** Things I put on this site might break you or not be allowed where you live.
